# Two-Sigma-Connect-Rental-Listing-Inquiries

Introduction & Overview of the problem:
Finding the perfect place to call your new home should be more than browsing through endless listings. RentHop makes apartment search smarter by using data to sort rental listings by quality. But while looking for the perfect apartment is difficult enough, structuring and making sense of all available real estate data programmatically is even harder. Two Sigma and RentHop, a portfolio company of Two Sigma Ventures, invite Kagglers to unleash their creative engines to uncover business value in this unique recruiting competition.
Two Sigma invites you to apply your talents in this recruiting competition featuring rental listing data from RentHop. Kagglers will predict the number of inquiries a new listing receives based on the listing’s creation date and other features. Doing so will help RentHop better handle fraud control, identify potential listing quality issues, and allow owners and agents to better understand renters’ needs and preferences.
